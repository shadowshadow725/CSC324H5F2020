Module: Ex3
Description: Exercise 3

This part of the exercise is similar in spirit to Exercise 2, except using
the Haskell programming language instead.

The one /new/ idea here is the use of the QuickCheck library to use a different
kind of approach to testing called /property-based testing/. We illustrate a
few simple property-based tests throughout this file.
