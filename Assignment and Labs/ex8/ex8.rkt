(make-change n)
  n: A non-negative integer.

  Returns a choice of a list of 1's and 5's whose sum is n. The returned list
  should be in *non-increasing order*, i.e., all 5's should appear before all 1's.

  You might want to lookup the "make-list" function.

(make-change-gen coins n)
  coins: A list of distinct positive integers, sorted in decreasing order.
  n: An integer.

  Returns a choice of a list of numbers in `coins` whose sum is `n`.
  The list should be sorted in non-increasing order.
  As before, coin values may be used more than once.

  If no possible combinations in `coins` sums to n (including when n is negative),
  *call (fail)*. (This is useful inside recursive calls.)
  But return an *empty list* if n = 0. These are different cases!

  Notes:
    1. We have started the pattern-matching for you, and strongly recommend building
       off of these patterns.
    2. You might need to have the output choices come out in a different order
       than in `make-change`. That's fine!

(solve-brute-force board)
  Returns a thunk containing a stream of solutions for the given Sudoku board.
  See `brute-force-helper` for details.
|#
(define (solve-brute-force board)
  (do/-< (brute-force-helper board 0)))

#|
(brute-force-helper board i)
  board: A Sudoku board, in the representation described above.
  i: The current index to consider. Precondition: 0 <= i < 81.

  Considers each board cell one at a time (recurses on `i`).
  Each time it encounters an empty cell, this algorithm creates a 
  *choice point* using `-<` for all 9 numbers that could fill the cell.
  It chooses a number, sets it in the vector, and moves on to the next cell.

  Only when the board is complete does this algorithm check if the board is solved;
  if it isn't, it calls (fail) to backtrack to the last choice point, and tries again.
|#
(define (brute-force-helper board i)
  (cond
    ; If there are no more choices to make, check if the puzzle is actually solved.
    [(>= i (vector-length board))
     (if (solved? board) board (fail))]

    ; If the current cell is occupied, move on to the next cell.
    [(not (blank? board i)) (brute-force-helper board (+ i 1))]

    ; Else, the current cell is empty. Make a new choice!
    [else
     (let* ([choice (-< 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)]
            [new-board (vector-set board i choice)])
       (brute-force-helper new-board (+ i 1)))]))

#|
`solve-with-constraints` (and its corresponding helper) are almost exactly the same
as `brute-force`. The only difference is in what choices are made; rather than 
using a static set of choices, the choices for each cell are generated dynamically
based on the current contents of the board.

Complete the helper `get-constraints` and then modify `with-constraints-helper` to
replace the (-< 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) expression. You may find the function `set->list`
helpful. You might also find it easier to call -< like this: (apply -< '(1 2 3)).
(You can change other things as well, although you shouldn't need to change much.)

  (do/-< (with-constraints-helper board 0)))

    ; (TODO: do you need to modify this?)
    [(>= i (vector-length board))
     (if (solved? board) board (fail))]

    ; If the current cell is occupied, move on to the next cell.
    ; (TODO: do you need to modify this?)
    [(not (blank? board i))
     (with-constraints-helper board (+ i 1))]

    ; Else, the current cell is empty. Make a new choice!

    [else
     (let* ([choice (-< 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)]

       (with-constraints-helper new-board (+ i 1)))]))

#|
(get-constraints board i)
  board: A Sudoku board
  i: integer?
    Precondition: i is the index of an *empty cell* in `board`.

  Returns a set of the possible numbers that can fill the empty cell.
  Starts with all 9 possible numbers, and removes the numbers that are
  in the same row, column or subsquare as the given cell.

  Note: You may assume we'll only test this function for the given precondition
  on `i`. In Task 2 you may find it useful to extend the documented behaviour
  for when `i` refers to an occupied cell in the board.
